# GitHub Pages and Jekyll

Static websites can be hosted for free as GitHub Pages.

Jekyll is a static website generator that can transform Markdown and Liquid
templates to HTML. Jekyll sites can be deployed to GitHub Pages for free with
support for custom domain names. This article only discusses the features I
used in my personal website so I encourage you 

```python
def sayhello():
  x = 2
  print('say hello')
  return x
```

Done.
