I am a research scientist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory near Knoxville, Tennessee. My current work is developing computational models to simulate the fast pyrolysis of biomass in fluidized reactors. This research is part of the [Consortium for Computational Physics and Chemistry](http://cpcbiomass.org/) for the U.S. DOE Bioenergy Technologies Office. I am also involved in various battery simulation activities as part of the [Consortium for Advanced Battery Simulation](https://vibe.ornl.gov/) project. As an enthusiastic developer, I organize the [Knoxville CocoaHeads](http://knoxcocoa.org/) and [KnoxPy](http://knoxpy.org/) programming groups.
