SQLite is a serverless relational database management system. Since it is self-contained it can be embedded in mobile apps, game consoles, and other media devices. The notes below are for the `sqlite3` command-line tool.

```bash
# open an existing file or create a new database file
sqlite3 mydatabase.db

# view all tables in a database
sqlite> .tables

# show all databases in current connection
sqlite> .databases

# help menu to see available sqlite commands
sqlite> .help

# exit or quit the sqlite command-line tool
sqlite> .exit
sqlite> .quit
```
