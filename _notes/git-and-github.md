# Git and GitHub

Tips on using Git and GitHub.

## Configuration

Set the user name and email address for every commit on the system. This only
needs to be done once if the global option is passed.

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

If you want to override this with a different name or email address for
specific projects, you can run the command without the global option when
youâ€™re in that project.

```bash
git config user.name "John Doe"
git config user.email johndoe@example.com
```

Use the list option to show the current configuration settings on your system.

```bash
git config --list
```

To keep your email private in your commits, GitHub offers a noreply email
address. On your GitHub profile, go to Settings then Emails to enable the
private email address feature.

You should also add a global ignore file. Use
[gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io) to create a file for macOS, vim,
python, and xcode. The contents of the ignore file will depend on your operating system and the applications you have installed. Place the file in
gitignore then tell Git to use it.

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore'
```

## Branch

Create a new branch which is referred to as "name-of-branch" in the examples
below:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-branch
```

Push the new branch to remote server named origin:

```bash
git push origin name-of-branch
```

List all local branches in normal or verbose mode:

```bash
git branch
git branch -v
```

Remove a local branch:

```bash
git branch -d name-of-branch
```

List all remote branches:

```bash
git branch -r
```

Remove a remote branch on origin:

```bash
git branch -dr origin/name-of-branch
```

## Orphan branch

When hosting a website on GitHub, the gh-pages branch can be used to keep the
web files separate from the project files. Since this branch is typically not
merged with other branches and would have its own history, the orphan option can be used. After creating the orphan branch, you should clear its
index and working tree to isolate it from the master branch.

```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
```

## Remote Repository

To list all remote branches use `git branch -r`.

To change the url to a remote repository use the command shown below.

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git
```

## Reset a Git and GitHub repository

When developing a website hosted on GitHub Pages, it can be convenient to
upload a beta version of the site for testing. Once the site is ready for
public viewing, the local and remote Git repositories can be reset to clean up
the commit history. The first step is to delete the `.git` folder in the local
directory then initialize a new Git repository in the same directory.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

After the local repo has been initialized, push it to the existing remote
GitHub server. The `--force` or `-f` option must be included in the push
command otherwise the existing remote repository on GitHub will not be reset.
Notice that the example below pushes to the `master` branch on GitHub but other
branches can be specified.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/tinkker/ztest.git
git push -f -u origin master
```

## Sync a Forked Repository

The commands below will sync a forked local repository with the original
upstream repository. These notes are based on the Stack Overflow question 
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository). 

```bash
# In the local repository, add the remote for the original "upstream" repo:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git

# Fetch all the branches of that remote:
git fetch upstream

# Make sure you're on the master branch in the local repo:
git checkout master

# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already
# in upstream/master are replayed on top of that other branch:
git rebase upstream/master

# Finally push up the changes to your own forked repo on GitHub:
git push
```
