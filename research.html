          <h4>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</h4>
          <h6>May 2013 to present</h6>
          <p>
          Conducting fast pyrolysis research of biomass particles in a bubbling
          fluidized bed reactor. Computational modeling of reactions in the
          system will provide insights on how to improve the conversion of
          woody biomass to a liquid bio-fuel. May 2013 to present.
          </p>
          <h4>Clemson University</h4>
          <p>
          Designed a custom buoy and terrestrial enclosure to remotely monitor
          environmental conditions as required for the Intelligent River
          Project. August 2012 to July 2013.
          </p>
          <h4>Clemson Engineering Technologies Lab (CETL)</h4>
          <p>
          Conducted research for the Savannah River National Lab for an argon
          environment electrical study using a custom designed glovebox and
          hydraulic dynamometer. Tested industrial electric motors in different
          gaseous environments under loaded and unloaded conditions to trace
          potential arcing issues. Voltage, current, and motor load were
          monitored and controlled using data acquisition equipment, various
          sensors and valves, and LabView software integration. May 2007 to May
          2011.
          </p>
          <h4>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</h4>
          <p>
          Conducted research for the Oak Ridge National Lab for a future
          biomass gasification steam facility. Modeled biomass gasification and
          system process flows to optimize operation of the facility and to
          determine air emissions from the combustion of various biomass fuels.
          Summer 2010.
          </p>
          <h4>Master's Research</h4>
          <p>
          Conducted research on biomass fuels in a custom designed furnace that
          replicated a small scale traveling-grate coal boiler. Compared air
          emissions and heat output of biomass briquettes to coal using an
          emissions analyzer, thermocouples, and a custom data acquisition
          system. Performed a biomass feasibility study of Clemson Universityâ€™s
          Experimental Forest based on the coal feed rate requirements of the
          campus boiler system. 2006 to 2011.
